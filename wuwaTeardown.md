# Video Game Teardown: Wuthering Waves: Closed Beta #2

## Introduction
Kuro Games is a prominent game development studio known for creating Punishing: Gray Raven, a popular action RPG (Role-Playing Game) set in a dystopian future. Founded in 2017, Kuro Games has begun work on their third game titled [Wuthering Waves] (WuWa), and recently closed their second Closed Beta test. 

This game plays closest to [Genshin Impact], another action RPG with similar mechanics. I have over 500 hours spent on the game, but burnt out of the game due to general disinterest of combat mechanics after a while, and lack of motivation to get stronger due to the randomness of certain mechanics. I mention this because a lot of comparrisons I will make will be made to Genshin.


## Gameplay Mechanics
This section will mainly focus on the differences between the combat system compared to Genshin. 

Although WuWa does contain elements like Genshin, there are no "reactions", or having an effect when two elements react with each other. The elemental system is more basic than Genshin with users only having to think about which element they are using when there are  monsters or bosses have resistances to a specific element. I will, however, argue that this allows users a better ease of entry into the combat system. Genshin contains approximately ten different reactions, each with a unique effect. Not only is this difficult to remember as a new player, but also creates an inherent advantage towards some characters in Genshin. Reactions that are deemed more "meta" will be used at a higher rate than those who are not deemed as useful, which adds a level of convolutedness to the combat system.

WuWa allows teams to only have three members compared to Genshin's four, but the teambuilding necessary to generate a well-rounded composition still exists. Some new mechanics are added in the combat system which inscentivizes switching characters at specific points.

Intro and Outro skills are added into the game which are used when the player swaps characters after certain period on the current character. When used, these skills damage, buff, or slow the enemy while also providing an outro / intro animation for the character leaving and entering respectively. Bosses usually also have shields, which are heavily damaged by a character's intro and outro skills.

The ability to wallrun, grapple, climb, and glide allow for so many different movement options that I never felt the "movement drag" that I had in genshin. Any building, wall, or cliff feels scalable, which incentivizes players to truly explore every part of the world. Furthermore, the stamina system is much more lax compared to Genshin, with WuWa allowing players to sprint without having to use stamina out of combat. This makes traveling much faster, and much more fun compared the Running, walking, and slowly climbing of genshin.

## Graphics and Visuals

#### Character Design
Each character has a unique look and design which generally reflects their personality and playstyle. However, the gravity physics of some characters are a bit exessive, and the unrealistic motion and design are often a little too much to overlook. More specifically, the chest design of some of the characters are immensely disproportionate and detract from the game. Although I am not an artist or someone well versed in fashion, I do enjoy the wide range of color scheme and styles of clothing that WuWa is implementing into their game. However, it is quite evident that it appeals to a predominately male audience, with none of the female characters wearing pants. Instead, all wearing dresses or skin tight leggings.  

#### World Design
The environment of the world covers a wide array of biomes and color schemes, and each one provides their own unique environmental "feel". The world flows with unique natural and unnatural ways that generate a sense of awe regardless of where one goes to and from. Night time creates a breathtaking view of the stars and galaxy, and I would sometimes even fall down cliffs or into enemies staring at the night sky rather than ahead of me.  

## Sound Design
[Examine the game's sound design, including the music, sound effects, and voice acting.]

## Story and Narrative
#### Storyline
The storyline is generally quite interesting, although a little generic. Because the main character is a self-insert character, the trope of "being transported to another world" is used, and doesn't really portray any novelty. Much like other RPGs, the player occasionally does have the ability to pick between a couple dialogue options. However, these options do not influence the game at all, rather, just provides one or two different text lines, which I always find a little disappointing. 

#### Syntax
The syntax of the game is hard to pick up, as, although they share a general motif, the amount of technical terms and names provided often left me confused at the beginning. Although they are able to explain and show the most important ones, some are left up to the player to figure out for them selves. Although this did not deter or negatively impact me, I can see it being a problem for a younger playerbase, who aren't able to keep up with the new vocabulary which is sprung on them. 

#### Plot
In general terms, the plot follows extremely closely to the "being transported to another world" story. To me, it was nothing great, and much of the time I found myself aimlessly clicking through the story rather than enjoying and gathering as much information I could from the text. Although there are moments that are truly made me feel engaged with the story, much of it was because of the animations and music that went along with it (which are talked about in other sections), rather than the plot itself.
